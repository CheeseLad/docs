I built www.dcumps.ie from the ground up to be a one-stop shop for everything related to MPS. When you log on, the website automatically gathers event data from our college society portal with a custom script I developed to ensure our members always have the latest event info. Our radio station, DCUfm, is embedded into the website along with a show timetable that syncs to your current time. The website has a gallery that allows our members to easily find photos and videos that were taken at the events. It also has a custom quick links system, history and information about the different subsections in MPS, dynamically updating videos from our YouTube channel and more!
