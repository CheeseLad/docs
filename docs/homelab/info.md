# Jake Farrell's Homelab Setup

## Introduction

My homelab consists of a Dell Optiplex 5060 running Debian 12 that was saved from an e-waste bin in my college. I have been using it to host various services and applications that I use on a daily basis. Configs for many of these services can be found in the `services` directory.
