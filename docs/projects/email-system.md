## Background

When researching on how to set up an email system with a custom domain, I discoverd Purelymail that was recommended by some members of Redbrick. It is cheap and easy to set up, with not much limitations on what you can do.

## Accessing your email in the browser

1. Go to the [Purelymail Website](https://purelymail.com/user/login)
2. Enter your email address and password (these will be provided to you by me)
3. Make sure you are on the `Webmail Login` and not the `Account Login`, otherwise you won't be able to log in.

## Changing your name and signature

1. Click on the `Settings` tab in the top left corner
2. Click on the `Identities` tab
3. Click on your email address, won't likely have your name yet
