# Email System

## Guide for accessing the email system and setting up your email on gmail.

### Guide is for:

- DCU MPS Committee
- The College View Editorial Team
- DCU Fotosoc Committee


## Background

When researching on how to set up an email system with a custom domain, I discoverd Purelymail which was recommended by some members of Redbrick. It is cheap and easy to set up, with not much limitations on what you can do.

## Information

- All emails will be in the format of `@dcumps.ie`, `@thecollegeview.ie` or `@dcufotosoc.ie`
- All emails sent to these accounts will automatically be sent to your college email address too. (Some emails marked as spam may not be forwarded, so make sure to check your Purelymail account regularly)

## Accessing your email in the browser

1. Go to the [Purelymail Website](https://purelymail.com/user/login)
2. Enter your email address and password (these will be provided to you by me)
3. Make sure you are on the `Webmail Login` and not the `Account Login`, otherwise you won't be able to log in.
