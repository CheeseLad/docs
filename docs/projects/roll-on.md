# Roll On

## Excerpt from Huawei's Blog Post

  Huawei announced the winners of the second Tech4Good Competition on January 5, with the Irish team winning the first prize for their solution "Roll On" that helps wheelchair users independently board trains. The Roll On ramp, powered by computer vision and IR sensors, is driven by AI and cloud computing linked over 5G. Roll On allows users to deploy a boarding ramp with their smartphone when needed.

  The Tech4Good Competition began in 2021, under Huawei's flagship Seeds for the Future digital skills training program. The competition encourages students to create solutions that utilize technology to address a social or environmental problem, and make the solutions commercially viable.
