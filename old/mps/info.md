# MPS (DCU's Media Production Society)

## What is MPS?

DCUâ€™s Media Production Society was founded in 1985, with the aim of operating as a creative and social outlet to a broad variety of students within the university. Composed of three strands, MPS offers the opportunity for its members to gain practical experience in their chosen field of media and collaborate with other, like-minded creatives. Over our 39 years of experience, MPS has thrived across the board, winning a variety of awards at both a University and a National level.
